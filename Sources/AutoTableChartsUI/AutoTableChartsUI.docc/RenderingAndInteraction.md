# Rendering and Interaction

Render memoized presentation data and link chart marks to source rows.

## Overview

``AutoChartSession`` publishes analyzing, preparing, ready, fallback, and failed
states while preventing superseded work from replacing newer state. Two
sessions can share one core cache while retaining independent preferences and
selections.

``AutoChartPresenter`` performs localization, formatting, ordering, and
histogram label resolution before a resolved chart body is evaluated. Its bounded
memo is keyed by prepared-chart identity, ``AutoChartPresentationContext``, the
effective locale and time zone, and host callback identity. Change the context
identity when the behavior captured by an existing callback changes. The
`AutoChartView` and `AutoChartPlot` convenience initializers accept
`presentationContext` for the same invalidation control and defer memo misses to
a cancellable presentation task. Call
``AutoChartConveniencePresentationCache/removeAll()`` to release the process-wide
convenience memo in response to memory pressure.

`AutoChartSelectionSet` is ordered and provenance-safe. A click replaces its
selection; Command-click removes a matched group when all its marks are selected
and otherwise completes the group. Every selected mark carries its analysis and
prepared-chart identities, and `unionedSourceRows` supports linked table filtering.
External binding updates are reflected by chart highlighting.

Use the environment modifiers `autoChartPresentationContext(_:)`,
`autoChartFormatters(_:)`, `autoChartTextResolver(_:)`,
`autoChartPalette(_:)`, and `autoChartTheme(_:)` to configure a subtree.
Only explicitly supplied environment values override presentation settings
passed to ``AutoChartSession/load(_:preference:preparation:presentationContext:formatters:textResolver:)``.
